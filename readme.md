Autos.com
=============

Autos.com seeks to create an unbiased, and clean approach to listing vehicles. Users are able to view, create, edit and delete listings, all the while having a persistent data state that they can access from anywhere. When creating a new vehicle listing, users can specify a Year, Make, Model, Price and a Photo URL if they choose. If they donâ€™t provide a URL, a default will be placed for them.
